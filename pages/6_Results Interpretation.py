- **Solid lines** = Rent & Invest strategy, **dotted lines** = Buy strategy.  
- **Crossing points** indicate the tipping year when investing surpasses owning (or vice versa).  
- Higher **monthly contributions** and **investment returns** accelerate Rent & Invest wealth.  
- Lower mortgage costs and stronger property appreciation improve Buy outcomes.  
- In the **short term (<10 years)**, renting often looks cheaper due to flexibility and lower upfront costs.  
- Over **long horizons (15‚Äì30 years)**, compounding from both property appreciation and investments become decisive.  

**Practical Implications**  
- üè† **Households**: Buying is stronger under low mortgage rates and steady appreciation. Renting can win when investment returns are high and rent remains affordable.  
- üíº **Financial Advisors**: Scenario comparisons help clients see how small changes in rates or returns shift long-term outcomes.  
- üèõÔ∏è **Policymakers**: Sensitivity results highlight how changes in interest rates, subsidies, or rental market conditions affect household wealth.
