- **Solid lines** represent the *Rent & Invest* strategy, while **dotted lines** show the *Buy* path.  
- The **crossing points** indicate the tipping year when renting & investing surpasses buying (or vice versa).  
- Higher **contributions** and **investment returns** accelerate Rent & Invest growth, while lower mortgage costs and stronger property appreciation favor Buying.  
- In the short term (<10 years), renting often looks cheaper due to flexibility and lower upfront costs. Over longer horizons (15‚Äì30 years), compounding effects from both property appreciation and investment returns become more significant.  
- For **households**, this highlights that the better option depends on personal circumstances:  
  - Buying is more attractive under low mortgage rates and steady property growth.  
  - Renting can outperform when investment returns are strong and rental costs remain affordable.  
- For **financial advisors**, scenario comparisons help clients see how small changes in rates or returns shift long-term outcomes.  
- For **policymakers**, sensitivity results highlight how interest rate changes, subsidies, or rental market conditions impact household wealth outcomes.
