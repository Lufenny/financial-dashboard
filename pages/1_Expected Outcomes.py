st.write("""
Under the baseline assumptions, two distinct wealth trajectories emerge:

- **Rent & Invest** demonstrates stronger compounding effects, growing more rapidly over the 20-year horizon. 
  The combination of an initial RM50,000 lump sum and steady 5% annual returns 
  allows this strategy to accumulate wealth at a faster pace than property ownership.  

- **Buy (Property Ownership)** builds wealth gradually through equity. 
  In the early years, equity remains modest due to high outstanding mortgage balances. 
  Over time, however, property appreciation (‚âà2% annually) and consistent mortgage repayments 
  reduce liabilities and increase the owner‚Äôs stake in the property.  

**Key Insight:**  
Renting and investing appears financially superior under these baseline conditions, 
especially in the short to medium term. Buying becomes more attractive if property appreciation accelerates, 
mortgage rates decrease, or holding periods extend well beyond 20 years.  

This baseline analysis provides a **reference benchmark** before applying sensitivity tests and scenario comparisons, 
which examine how changes in assumptions (e.g., higher appreciation or lower returns) alter long-term outcomes.
