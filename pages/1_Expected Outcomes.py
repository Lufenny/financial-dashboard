# --- Interpretation ---
st.header("üìù Interpretation of Expected Outcomes")
st.write("""
- Under baseline assumptions (property appreciation ‚âà2%, EPF-like returns ‚âà5%), the **Rent & Invest strategy grows faster** due to higher compounding.  
- The **Buy strategy** gradually builds equity as the property value rises and mortgage balance decreases.  
- In early years, homeowners carry more debt, so equity is modest. Over time, property appreciation and mortgage repayments increase Buy wealth.  
- Meanwhile, renters benefit from both lower initial costs and consistent investment growth, making Rent & Invest more competitive under baseline assumptions.  

This baseline comparison provides a reference point before applying **sensitivity and scenario analyses**, which explore how outcomes change under different assumptions.
