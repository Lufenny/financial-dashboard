# 📊 Financial Dashboard — Rent vs Buy Analysis  

> This project develops an interactive financial dashboard to analyze the long-term trade-offs 
between **buying a home** and **renting & investing**. Using real economic data (EPF returns, 
OPR rates, property appreciation, rental yields), the model simulates wealth accumulation, 
sensitivity scenarios, and tipping points. The tool is deployed via Streamlit Cloud, 
making financial planning insights accessible to households, advisors, and policymakers.

An interactive **Streamlit dashboard** that simulates long-term wealth outcomes of **buying a home vs renting and investing** in Kuala Lumpur.  

It allows households, advisors, and policymakers to test different assumptions (mortgage rates, property growth, EPF returns, rental yields) and identify **tipping points** where one strategy becomes financially superior.
